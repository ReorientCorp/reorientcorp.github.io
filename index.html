                <div class="more-container">
                    <p>Modern fighter jets, including the F-35, use 3D audio cues to enhance situational awareness and
                        reduce pilot workload. These spatially localized sounds help pilots quickly interpret threats,
                        navigation data, and system alerts. However, during high-G maneuvers, these cues can become
                        mislocalized, making sounds appear out of position as the central nervous system struggles to
                        reconcile auditory input with signals from other sensory systems (e.g., vestibular,
                        proprioceptive).

                    <p>Reorient Corp is collaborating with the U.S. Air Force&#39;s 711th Human Performance Wing and the
                        Naval
                        Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory (NAMRL) to conduct human subject experiments aimed at
                        provoking, modeling, and mitigating these complex perceptual illusions.

                <input name="checkPC" type="checkbox" id="togglePC" hidden>
                <div class="more-container">
                    <p>Pilots, astronauts, and vehicle operators experience complex motion environments that challenge
                        human
                        perception of orientation and movement. Accurately modeling these perceptual responses is
                        critical
                        for improving training, simulation fidelity, and safety.
                    </p>
                    <p>Reorient Corp is developing Perception Computer, a spatial orientation modeling platform that
                        integrates motion data from diverse sourcesâ€”flight recorders, simulators, research devices, and
                        even
                        mobile sensors. For decades, perception models have been developed for and within the academic
                        domain, limiting their accessibility and practical application. Perception Computer eliminates
                        these
                        barriers by providing a web-based platform built on open technologies, making it easier for
                        researchers and engineers to use and improve these models. Over time, the platform will
                        incorporate
                        models from academic literature and a growing database of experimental validation data, enabling
                        new
                        ways to visualize and understand human motion perception.</p>

                    <p>Despite the growing availability of stormwater data, barriers like inconsistent formats and data
                        silos continue to limit its impact. To advance research, infrastructure planning, and
                        decision-making, data must be more accessible, integrated, and actionable.
                    </p>
                    <p>Reorient Corp is developing a new web-based stormwater data platform for the Villanova Center for
                        Resilient Water Systems. This second-generation system is built around the Stormwater
                        Infrastructure
                        Data Model (SIDM), designed to streamline data organization, retrieval, and analysis. The
                        platform
                        will provide researchers, municipalities, and utilities with tools to log, visualize, and
                        analyze
                        spatiotemporal stormwater data, enabling better collaboration and deeper insights into system

                    <p>Traditional construction management platforms are designed for large-scale projects in highly
                        connected environments, making them impractical for infrastructure development in remote
                        regions.
                        Limited internet access, language barriers, and field communication challenges often hinder
                        effective oversight.

                    <p>Reorient Corp, in collaboration with GBC, is developing Global Build Solutions, a web-based
                        platform
                        built specifically for managing construction projects in the developing world. Currently
                        deployed in
                        Uganda, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the system enables field teams to
                        document progress using a mobile app that works offline, syncing when connectivity is available.
                        Field reports, photos, and milestone tracking are streamlined into a centralized system,
                        allowing
                        engineers to review, provide feedback, and request additional context. Designed for simplicity
                        and
